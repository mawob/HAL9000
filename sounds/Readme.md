These are all HAL 9000 sound clips (001.mp3 - 095.mp), a message (096.mp3), 
and four wonderful Sci-Fi beeps (beeps1.mp3 - beeps4.mp3) 
from the movie "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968).

The numbering of the sound clips corresponds to the numbering from this list

--- bonus:

I added sound clips from Woody Allen's movie "Sleeper" (1973) in which
the computer was also voiced by Douglas Rain.
The sound clips were edited to remove specific references to the "Sleeper" 
movie, so the final clips can be merged with the "2001: A Space Odyssey" clips.
(removed were the name "Dr. Tamkin", the name of the computer "biocentral 
computer 2100 series G", and the reference to the "cloning procedure")

001 Hello, ... , so nice to see you.  ("Dr. Tamkin" was removed)
002 I'll be assisting you through the entire process.
003 May I say Doctor, we're all aware of your reputation.
004 You can see the coded medical history on readout four.
005 We're ready to proceed.
006 Excuse me Doctor, but that would be a tragic mistake.
007 I think it's time to check the cell structure.
008 Something is going wrong. There's been a current break in the life support system.
